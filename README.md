It allows you to automate workflows for your GitHub repositories, automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code.

Basic Concepts of Jenkins.
Job: A Job is the basic building block in Jenkins and represents a task or job. It can be a build, test, deployment, or other type of task.
Build: A build is the process of executing a task, which typically includes checking out code from a source code repository, performing a compile, running tests, and generating a build product.
Node: A node is a working machine in Jenkins, it can be a Master or an Agent. Agent nodes can share the build tasks and reduce the load on the master node.
